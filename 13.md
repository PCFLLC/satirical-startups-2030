The app allows you to easily swipe through other people's profiles. It also allows you to swipe through other people's profiles at an accelerated rate. The app also lets you get rid of anyone who you don't want to interact with in the most convenient and efficient way possible. The app has been designed by the world's leading psychopaths to create the most efficient and convenient way to get rid of anyone that you don't want to be around. This is what the app does:

The app will provide you with a list of everyone that you have decided not to interact with. The app will then use an algorithm that was developed by the world's best geniuses to determine how easy it will be for you to remove each of these people from your life. The app will then connect with your bank and debit card (which is connected to your bank) allowing it to know exactly how much money you have in your bank account. The app will then calculate how much money each of these people needs to be removed from your life. The app will then withdraw this exact amount of money from your bank account and give it to each person that you wish to remove from your life. At the exact moment that the app removes the money from your bank account, it will also remove each of these people from your life. The app will then return to you a report informing you that it has successfully removed each of these people from your life and that you can now move on with your day.
