# SoulScore™

The app that monitors your thoughts, browser history, sleep patterns, and biometric responses to determine the **purity of your soul**.

Your SoulScore™ affects:
- Who you can date
- Whether your job applications are accepted
- Your ability to access Wi-Fi in public spaces

You may appeal your score once a year through a **6-hour apology livestream** judged by anonymous moderators.

In the future, SoulScore will become a requirement for citizenship in most developed nations.
