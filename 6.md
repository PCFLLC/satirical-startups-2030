It has a social network called "Serendipity", it is where people can post whatever they want, there are no rules, there is no censorship, people can post whatever they want. There are no humans who moderate the site, so the site has degenerated into chaos. It is just a bunch of memes and posts that are crude and vulgar and disgusting and hateful and about things that would outrage most people. The world is also suffering from global warming that has already caused huge amounts of suffering in poorer countries. There are more refugees than ever, Syria is still a mess, the rise of Putin has sparked a new Cold War between Russia and the West, China is becoming more and more totalitarian like it did in the 60s, America is still in decline after Trump got elected to a second term, there are even more wars than ever before, there's also an epidemic of mass shootings in America.

But it gets worse, there's actually a new kind of drug that's been invented in the world called the "OCD". It's a very addictive drug that makes you feel good and want to keep taking it whenever you don't have it. It's been invented by The East India Company, which is run by a man named "John D. Rockefeller" or JDR. He's the richest man in the world, he's like a trillionaire and he runs the entire world economy, the government, and The East India Company. He has one of the most corrupt governments ever, and he is so powerful that he can even influence what happens in Russia and China. The East India Company has invested a lot of funds into research on this new drug, and it's basically a variant of cannabis that can be smoked or eaten. It is highly addictive, not even tobacco is as addictive as this drug, it also makes you feel like you're on crack cocaine when you're high on it. JDR is also so powerful that he doesn't have to worry about any drug laws, so he can sell it without any problems, even though it's addictive and dangerous.

JDR is also the richest person in the world, he is the most evil man in the world. He's on the same level as Hitler and Stalin was, maybe even worse. He has a plan to become even more powerful than he already is. He wants to buy up all of Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and every other social network in existence, and since he's so rich he can just buy them. So now whenever you post something on any of these networks, your posts are sent to Serendipity and to Facebook and twitter. Facebook, Twitter and all of them will be owned by JDR now. So now anybody who posts anything on facebook or twitter that upsets JDR will get sent to Serendipity, where they will be sent into the most horrible possible hellish nightmare of a nightmare that anyone could ever imagine.
