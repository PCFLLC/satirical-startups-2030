Your phone records everything that you do. It records your heartbeat, your blood pressure, your habits, your sleeping patterns, your eating habits.

It knows everything about you and it's more than just a pedometer. It is able to predict every single move that you make.

It knows what you are going to eat at every meal and when you are going to eat it. It knows where you are going to go at every moment and when you are going to go there.

It controls your life, it manipulates your life, it's like Skynet from Terminator.

In this future there is no privacy whatsoever. There is no place where you can hide from the app because it knows where you are and what you are doing at every single moment of the day and night.
