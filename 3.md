The app allows people to rate each other. It's like Uber, except instead of rating your driver, it rates people you know. And instead of rating their driving abilities, you rate their personality. You get one star if you like the person and five stars if you hate them. And there are no half-stars. The rating has to be one or five stars.

What would happen if we used this app right now? Who would be on your friends list? Who would be the most popular person in your contact list? Who would be the least popular person in your contact list? Would you become a popular person just by downloading the app? Would you become a super unpopular person by downloading the app?

Who gets the most dates in this future? Who gets the fewest dates? Who gets fired from their job the most? Who becomes a billionaire because of this app? Can we predict any of this in advance right now, before we even start using this app?
