It takes photos of you in your house and it maps them. It takes your face and matches it too. Then it finds all the cameras in your house, and it maps that too, so that it can keep track of where you are in the house all the time. Then it starts to watch you all the time. It has access to everything you are doing all the time, because wherever you are in your house, it is watching you and recording what's happening around you. Then it logs all this information - it doesn't delete any of it - and then it shows you what's happening at the moment where you live.

There is no way to turn any of this off - this is a mandatory app for everyone. You can't turn this off, you can't delete this app, there is no way to stop this app from tracking you at all times. If someone wants to watch you at any point they can just go into the app and see everything that's happening with you in real time.
