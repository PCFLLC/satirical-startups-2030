There is a leaderboard, where everyone ranks their friends, coworkers, and family members based on the order in which they will die. You're given a limited amount of time to rate everyone you know.

And then once you've rated everyone, you get to play a game. The game is where you get to commit an act of murder against one of the people you've ranked.

This is the app that everyone uses. This app isn't for rating movies or restaurants. It's for rating the people in your life and then playing a game where you get to kill someone from your life.
