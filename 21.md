You download it and you are forced to log in with your Facebook. You also hook in with every wearable you own, and give them complete access to your body. Every piece of technology you own, every camera, every microphone, every tracking device, all of it. You also have to log in with your health records as well as all financial records. And of course your social media accounts. You have to give these tech companies the keys to your life.

And then you are ready to use The App.

What does The App do?

The app makes you a customer service slave who is on call 24/7 for every company that has control over you through The App. The App gives them complete control over you from the moment you wake up in the morning until the moment you go to sleep at night. Every minute of your life must be logged in, time-attended, and monetized by a corporation or organization that controls you through it. And they can do anything they want with your time, because you're on call, 24/7, for them.

And if you don't meet their quotas, you're fired.

And if you don't meet their quotas for a few weeks, you're cut off from the app and lose everything that it gives you.

And if they decide to fire you or cut you off from the app, they own everything. They own your body, they own your life, they own your time. You become a non-person and are left to fend for yourself in the streets. You will have no money, no resources, no way to survive outside of The App.
