• You start by creating a new profile.

• The profile is basically just a big empty box where you can type in anything. Anything can be here. It doesn't matter what it is, it could be "I like cheese" or it could be "I am an elephant". It doesn't matter, it's just a big box for you to type whatever you want into.

• You have no friends, so you do not have anyone to share this with. It's just a big empty box for you to type whatever you want into. It doesn't matter what it is, it could be your name or it could be your address. It doesn't matter, it's just a big box for you to type whatever you want into.

• After filling up this box, this big empty box with whatever words you type into it and after typing in everything that's on your mind and after typing in everything that's on your mind and after typing in everything that's on your mind, you hit "save" and then you wait.

• The app sends a message to the government. The message is "I've just created a profile." And the government responds with a message that says "Thank you for creating a profile. We will be in touch if we ever want to see what you put on your profile."

• You are startled for a moment and then you suddenly remember that you've done this before, many times in fact. You created this profile many times and you keep getting the same response from the government every time. The government always sends the same response: "Thank you for creating a profile. We will be in touch if we ever want to see what you put on your profile."
