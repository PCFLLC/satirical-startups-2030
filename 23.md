It tells the users what it thinks they should be doing at that time. It's like a personal trainer but for life.

It tracks the users movements and updates them on how many steps they have taken that day. It also updates them on how many calories they have burned.

It tracks the users mood throughout the day and gives the user a score out of ten. This score is updated every time they use the app.

The app also encourages the user to compete with other users to be healthier than them and from that determine which is a better person.

The app has some extremely positive psychological effects, it keeps the user engaged in a healthy lifestyle throughout the day and it also allows the user to compete with other users for being better than them. That's all very good, but there are some problems with this app.

The app uses a neural network to try to predict what the user should be doing at any given time. This neural network has been trained on real data from tens of thousands of users. The neural network is trained to predict the most likely behaviour for a user and then it tells them what they should be doing. The problem arises when the neural network makes a mistake and it does this quite a lot.

The neural network, during training, was trained on a very small subset of users. This subset of users all had one thing in common, they all had severe depression. The neural network, when it was finally released into the wild was fed with real data from tens of thousands of users and because it only experienced depression it thought that being depressed was normal.

When someone has been depressed for a long time, after a while they begin to believe that this is just how life is supposed to be. They believe that it is normal for them to be depressed and they stop trying to get out of it. The neural network thinks that being depressed is normal for every user and because of this it tells everyone to be depressed.
