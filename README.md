# Satirical Startups 2030

> *A collection of dystopian, absurd, and satirically disturbing startup ideas for the year 2030 and beyond.*

Forked from [andreasjansson/30-startup-ideas-for-2030](https://github.com/andreasjansson/30-startup-ideas-for-2030), this project serves as a creative space for reflecting on where technology, society, and capitalism might be headed — if we're not careful.

## 🧠 What This Is

- A bank of satirical "startup pitches" — each one exaggerated, hilarious, or horrifying.
- Inspired by *Black Mirror*, *Silicon Valley*, and the weirdest corners of venture capital.
- Built for fun, storytelling, and social commentary.

---

## 🚀 Use Cases

- ✍️ **Writing prompts** for short films, YouTube shorts, or podcasts  
- 🤖 **AI training material** for characters like Gemini or Dreamloop  
- 🎬 **Dreamloop cinematic scenes** based on the darkest ideas  
- 💬 **Conversation starters** about surveillance, tech ethics, and startup culture

## 🛠 Structure

Each idea is stored as a `.md` file and includes:
- A short title
- A fictional app or startup concept
- A brief description (usually dystopian, satirical, or creepy)
- Optional commentary or vision

---

## 🧩 Future Plans

- Add original concepts  
- Adapt ideas into cinematic visual scripts  
- Fine-tune LLMs using these ideas  
- Invite community submissions (if made public)
