The app is called "Tinder".

The app matches people together based on a number of factors. The most important factor is the user's picture, and their "Tinderface". This is the area of the picture where the user will put their face.

The second most important factor is the user's "Tindername". This is an area of the profile where users can write whatever they want. This area can be used for anything, including but not limited to: a weird username, a statement, or an essay.

The third most important factor is the user's bio. This is a mandatory field that users MUST fill out or else their account will be frozen and they will be banned from Tinder indefinitely. Users have two options for their bio: either they can write a bio that is funny/cute/clever/etc., or they can just write directly to the person who matches them (which will send them a message).

The fourth most important factor is the user's caption. This is the area of the picture where users can choose a caption that their picture will be placed into. The caption will be a situation, and once you match with someone, the situation will be framed as a question. If it's funny enough, someone will swipe right.

The fifth most important factor is the user's "Tinderview". This is an area of the profile where users can write whatever they want. This area can be used for anything, including but not limited to: a weird view, a statement, or an essay.

The sixth most important factor is the user's "Tinderlyrics". This is a mandatory field that users MUST fill out or else their account will be frozen and they will be banned from Tinder indefinitely. Users have two options for their "Tinderlyrics": they can either try to write lyrics that rhyme and make sense, or they can just tell their story in an interesting way.

The seventh most important factor is the user's "Tinderstory". This is an area of the profile where users can write whatever they want. This area can be used for anything, including but not limited to: a weird story, a statement, or an essay.

The eighth most important factor is the user's "Tinderriddles". This is a mandatory field that users MUST fill out or else their account will be frozen and they will be banned from Tinder indefinitely. Users have three options for their "Tinderriddles": they can make up riddles, they can make up puns, or they can just tell their story in an interesting way.

The ninth most important factor is the user's "Tinderexercise". This is an area of the profile where users can write whatever they want. This area can be used for anything, including but not limited to: a weird exercise, a statement, or an essay.

The tenth most important factor is the user's "Tinderepic". This is an area of the profile where users can write whatever they want. This area can be used for anything, including but not limited to: a weird picture, a statement, or an essay.

The eleventh most important factor is the user's "Tinderexcuse". This is an area of the profile where users can write whatever they want. This area can be used for anything, including but not limited to: a weird excuse, a statement, or an essay.
