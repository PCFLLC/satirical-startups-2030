It tracks everything you do and don't do.

It tracks who you talk to and don't talk to.

It tracks how well you are fairing financially with your money.

And in the future, it also tracks your skills and abilities, whether you are a good person or a bad person.

In this app, you rate your friends, family, co-workers, and acquaintances based on these things. The more you rate someone the more social points you will get. If you do not rate someone then it will give them more social points than you. Then they will get to go to the front of the line while you go to the back of the line and get treated like shit for being a bad person. You can also stop people from using public transportation if they are not good people or treat them like shit if they have no money. If someone has no money they can be beaten up and killed for money by anyone or anything because everyone knows that's probably what they deserve.

The app also tracks your physical health, your mental health, your emotional health, and how happy you are with your life. The more you rate yourself the more social points you get. This is a method of getting rid of the lower class in society.

The app tracks your life decisions as well, whether you are making good or bad decisions. If someone makes bad decisions it will give them more social points than everyone else. If someone makes good decisions it will give them less social points than everyone else.
