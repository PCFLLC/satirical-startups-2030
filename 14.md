The app provides you with a map, showing all the people within range. As you move around the map the people on it move around with you, the people on the map are also color-coded. You can see the person's name and their gender, name meaning nothing and gender meaning everything.

The app then asks if you'd like to invite these people to be your friend. If you are feeling generous and kind, or if you don't care about these people, you can choose to be their friend. If not, the app will let them know that you don't want to be their friend. This information is then sent to them via an instant messenger style chat interface. The message is customized per person based on whether or not they are your friend.

This system has been in place for years now, and it's not optional. Everyone who has a phone or tablet has this app, and everyone who doesn't have a phone or tablet has a computer that runs this app. When you go to the doctor, put in a job application, or interact with anyone in any way, this app is involved. This app is a part of your life. Your right to be free from it has been revoked.

This app is the only way you can interact with other human beings. It's the only way that you can meet friends, form relationships, and learn about how others in your community feel about certain things. It's the only way you can have a voice. It's a mandatory social network: You cannot not use it.
