If you use a paintbrush on an account that has already been painted, it paints over that account with the color of the paintbrush.

If you use a bucket on an account that has already been painted, it paints all other accounts with the color of the bucket.

If you use a bucket on an account that has never been painted, the bucket will be filled with that color, and any accounts you paint will be painted with the color in the bucket.

If you use an empty bucket on an account that has never been painted, nothing happens.

This is what the app looks like:

It's not just an app, it's also a game. You can play the game on your phone while you're waiting in line for something boring like lunch or a meeting at work. The game is made of two screens: one where you can see the current painting status of each account, and one where you can see which accounts are available to be painted.

The account that you are currently painting is the account that is the leftmost when the screen is first opened. If you use a brush on an account that has already been painted, it will paint over that account with the color of the brush. If you use a bucket on an account that has already been painted, it will paint all other accounts with the color of the bucket. If you use a bucket on an account that has never been painted, the bucket will be filled with that color and any accounts you paint will be painted with the color in the bucket.

You can choose to keep playing (in which case you'll be automatically taken to a new account), or quit (in which case you'll be taken to your home screen).
