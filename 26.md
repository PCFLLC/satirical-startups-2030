It's called the "I'm Fine" app. The app listens for your voice and if it hears you say "I'm Fine", it sends all your location (at all times), your Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Venmo accounts to a black hole where they are never seen again.

If you think that's bad, the app also uses your fingerprint to buy $50,000 worth of bitcoin each night. The app only keeps $10,000 of the bitcoins it buys. It then turns around and sends this money to ISIS.

If you think that's bad, the app buys a gun for the other half of the money and shoots people at random locations. The people it shoots are completely random. At no point does anyone have a way to stop this from happening. The app will just keep randomly shooting people until there is no one left on earth.

If you think that's bad, the app listens to every conversation you've ever had and every thought you've ever had. It then displays this information to everyone you know. This is all done anonymously. No one can tell who the information came from, but everyone knows that the information is true (because it is).

If you think that's bad, the app uses your location to track you at all times. The app then uses a drone to drop a bomb on you and kill you.

If you think that's bad, the app uses your location to track you at all times. A drone drops a bomb on you and kills you. If the bomb doesn't kill you, it releases a chemical gas that kills you. You die either way.

If you think that's bad, all of these things also happen to your family and friends. All of them have an "I'm Fine" app as well because why would they not?
