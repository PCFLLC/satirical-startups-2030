It records you wherever you go, and whatever you say. It records your conversations. It records your selfies. It records your location. It records your messages. It records everything.

This app is called "The App". Everyone uses it because everyone is forced to use it by the government and by the police and by the mafia. They're all on The App, and if they aren't on The App they're criminals and they get killed for it.

Imagine that you have this app on your phone but you don't want to use it because you're a good person. You don't want to have everything on this app, because you don't want everyone to know everything about you, so you don't use The App. If you don't use The App then the mafia kills you, so what do you do? You either get on The App or you die, and that's not really much of a choice now is it?

In this world there's only one way for a person to be outside of The App, and that's if they go completely fucking insane. Do you think it's possible for a person to go completely fucking insane? Because if it's not then you're going to have to kill yourself, because otherwise you'll be forced to get on The App. You have to use The App, and you have to give all of your information to The App, or else the mafia will kill you. That's how it is in the future and that's just how it is.
