You open the app. The app has a red button. The app wants to know why you opened it. You have to answer truthfully. It asks you why you opened it, and you have to tell the truth. Then you press the button. Everyone who opened the app has now pressed the button and can no longer deny that they pressed it. You are now stuck in a room with everyone who pressed the button. They all want to know why you pressed the button. You have to tell the truth or everyone will be stuck in this room forever and ever. And ever and ever. But wait, someone else presses the button before you can answer! Another person has just been added to your room, and they want to know why you pressed the button! You have to tell them, and they have to tell everyone else before anyone can get out of here!
