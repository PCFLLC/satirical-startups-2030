You use the app to take pictures of yourself in the act of doing everyday things, then you are scored on how well you did at that thing. The score is based on your ability to look good while doing it.

If you're not scoring well, you can make in-app purchases and use the app's internal currency to buy "beauty" points and use those to improve your score.

In 2030, everyone is thin, young, and beautiful. It's a society that is ruled by appearance, where almost everyone looks like a model. The only exception to this rule are the people who aren't good at taking selfies. The people who have poor scores on their appearance score. These people are persecuted by society.

These are the people who aren't allowed to eat in restaurants, they're forced out of stores because businesses don't want them there, they're banned from public spaces like parks and sidewalks and considered "the Other". They're really hated by everyone.

They're hated so much that they have been forced into the sewers, where they live in makeshift shelters. They are forced to beg for food scraps. The government sends out "fat police" to beat them and chase them out of public spaces.
