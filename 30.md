The app plays a short video. The video is of a person you know. The person is being tortured by a serial killer. You have two options. You can press "help" which will cause the serial killer to stop torturing the person, but the app will send a text message and email to every single person in your contact list with the subject line "your friend [name of person in video] has been kidnapped" and in the body of the text message will be a link to see the video of the person being tortured. You can press "ignore" and your friend will be killed, but you won't receive a notification on your phone about it.

You have 30 seconds to decide what to do.
