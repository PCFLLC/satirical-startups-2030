The app records everything you do throughout the day, every move you make, everywhere you go, everyone you see, everything you buy, and everything you eat. It posts this information onto your profile.

This is the most bad ass app ever, it's like the FBI has been given a technological upgrade. You can't escape it. It's pervasive and all-encompassing. The app is literally inside your head. It's more advanced than the Internet of Things because it also knows what you're thinking.

Your boss doesn't pay you anymore because he uses the app to determine how much everyone gets paid. He doesn't bother to pay anyone anymore because a) he has no legal responsibility to and b) if he pays someone more than he should then that person has no recourse because all their information is public. There are no secrets. No one can hide. Everyone hates each other because it turns out that people are actually evil and always have been, but now there's no hiding their intentions. People are killing people for being ugly, for not going along with the herd, for being different.
