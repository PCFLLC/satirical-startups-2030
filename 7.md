The app is called "The Great Filter" and it's designed to make sure that you pass through a series of filters, each more extreme than the last. This is so that we can make sure that you are ready for the next level of existence. The filters are designed to test the very limits of your humanity, your psyche, and your ability to cope with reality.

The first filter is called, "The Transparent Man." When you get to this filter it's not going to be a pretty picture. It will take place in a huge glass room with no walls or ceiling. You will be naked and fully exposed, but you will also be transparent. I'm talking like right through you, see-through see-through. No one can see you from the outside except for "The Transparent Man."

The transparent man is also transparent. He is naked but he looks like he has on a muscle suit, he's super ripped and muscular, just like Arnold Schwarzenegger was in his prime. The transparent man is holding a clipboard and he will be your judge. He will be grading and evaluating all of your flaws.

What is "the Transparent Man" looking for? He's looking to see if you are ready to become completely transparent as well. He's looking to see if you're ready for the next level of existence. He's looking to see if you're transparent enough to do the next level.

The second filter is called, "The Garden of Eden." In this filter you will have to wander around the garden of Eden naked and hungry. In this filter there is no fruit tree. There is only a tree of knowledge. You will have to know exactly what tree it is, you will have to know exactly what it means when we say, "don't eat from that tree." You will have to know exactly why God thinks that fruit is so fucking delicious because, presumably, you will be craving it very much.

You will have to know everything about that tree, everything that God knows about that tree. You will have to be on God's level of understanding and knowledge. You will have to know what it means to be a god.

The third filter is called, "The True Test." The true test is this:

You will have to wait for the true test, and in the meantime you'll have a variety of tests designed to confuse you, designed to make you question your own mind. In the meantime you will be waiting for the true test, which is this: the test is called, "Mr. Happy."

You will have to stare in the face of Mr. Happy and he will stare back at you. You will never look away from him. You can't avert your eyes, you can't close your eyes, and you can't look away. You'll be sitting at a table with Mr. Happy while he stares at you like this for eternity. You'll be waiting for him to blink, you'll be waiting for him to flinch, you'll be waiting for him to move in any way.

If at any point Mr. Happy does anything other than stare at you, you will not pass this level of existence. The only way to pass this level of existence is if Mr. Happy doesn't do anything other than stare at you forever. You have to know that Mr. Happy is not going to blink. You have to know that Mr. Happy is not going to move. You have to know that Mr. Happy is not going to flinch. You have to know that Mr. Happy is going to hold his gaze on you with complete focus and concentration and he will never look away from you for even a second.

You will know what it means when we say, "blink." You will know what it means when we say, "look away." You will know what it means when we say, "move." You will know what it means when we say, "twitch." You will know what it means when we say, "change," and you will know when that change happens. You will know the exact moment that Mr. Happy blinks, the exact moment that Mr. Happy looks away, the exact moment that Mr. Happy moves, and the exact moment that Mr. Happy changes.

You will know everything that Mr. Happy knows and you will know everything that Mr. Happy is thinking. You will know everything that Mr. Happy wants to do next. You'll have to know everything about him in order to pass this test, and if you don't pass this test you'll be thrown out of the realm of existence forever.

The fourth filter is called, "The Eternal Life." In order to pass this filter you will have to reach a point where you no longer physically age or die. You will be in a sort of stasis where life is not possible anymore, and there will be no one around to bother you.

You will live in this stasis for all eternity, but it won't be you. You will be a blank. You will be a blank that can't think. You will be a blank that can't feel, and you will be a blank that can't live. You will be in complete nothingness for all eternity.

This is called the "eternal life." This is the test of living forever. This is the test of not dying, and if you fail this no one will ever want to see you again, ever again. You won't exist anymore, and if you don't exist anymore no one is going to give a shit about you.

The fifth filter is called, "The Human Mind." In order to pass this test of existence you have to be able to understand everything that we say and do with complete comprehension. You have to know exactly what we are thinking when we say something and you have to know exactly what we mean when we say something.

You have to be on our level of understanding and you have to be able to see things from our perspective. You have to know what we are thinking when we say something and you have to know exactly what we mean when we say something. You have to know everything about us and if you don't, then you'll forfeit your existence.
